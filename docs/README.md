# Docs (GitHub index)

This repo is **CLI-first** and **truthful-by-default**. The best starting point is the top-level `README.md`.

This page is the canonical index of documentation intended for GitHub.

## Notes

Older internal planning documents were moved out of `docs/` to keep the public surface area clean.
