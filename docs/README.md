# Docs (GitHub index)

This repo is **CLI-first** and **truthful-by-default**. The best starting point is the top-level `README.md`.

This page is the canonical index of documentation intended for GitHub.

## Public / OSS docs (recommended)

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — what exists now, data flows, and boundaries
- `CLI_REFERENCE.md` — current `ritma`/`ritma_cli` commands
- `EVIDENCE_AND_ATTESTATION.md` — artifacts produced today and how to verify them
- `UX_GATE.md` — UX acceptance checklist / contract
- `RITMA_UX_CONTRACT_30_COMMANDS.md` — command tree contract

## Internal / legacy / deployment-heavy docs

The repo historically contained additional deployment/pilot/enterprise planning documents.
For GitHub cleanliness, those have been moved into `.local_archive/` and are intentionally not pushed.
